# College
I am attending the **University of Missouri** to get and agribusiness management degree. I want to be able  
to use this degree to help on our farm and help my brothers run our produce business. But, while getting  
this degree I want to explore other careers and classes in college to broaden my knowledge and confirm  
that agribusiness is the degree that I want.
